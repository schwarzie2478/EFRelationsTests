# EFRelationsTests

A simple Test project where I have made a couple of unit tests 
to try out the different ways Entity Framework reacts with Code-First approach 
and how to work with the Fluent api to configure my tables.

I only test one unit test at a time in the current version. 

Every time the database is droppred and recreated according to the model EF thinks he needs.
This way we see how the default configuration  works more easily.
